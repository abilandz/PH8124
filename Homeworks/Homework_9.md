**Challenge #1:** Write down one-line code snippet in **Bash** which will return 0 if the first 20 lines (let's say) in two files are the same, and return 1 otherwise. 

**Hint:** Combine **diff**, process substitution operator ```<( ... )```, and **head**. 

**Challenge #2:** Write down one-line code snippet which will print on the screen all files in your home directory which were modified within the last 24h.

**Challenge #3:** Develop a **Bash** function named **Converter** which takes as an argument directory. Then, in that directory and all of its subdirectories it converts all '.eps' files into '.pdf' files. 

**Hint:** To convert a single '.eps' file into '.pdf' file, use the command: **epstopdf someFile.eps**
